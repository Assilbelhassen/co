Oil and gas are important natural resources that help power our world.

Oil is a thick, black liquid found underground. It is used to make gasoline for cars, diesel for trucks, and many other products like plastic and medicines.

Gas, often called natural gas, is a type of fuel found in underground rock formations. It is used for heating homes and cooking food.

Oil and gas come from deep underground, and people use special machines to find and bring them to the surface. Once collected, oil and gas are cleaned and processed in big factories to be turned into useful products.

The oil and gas industry helps us in many ways but also needs to be careful to protect the environment while doing its work.
